      Solaria is a mirror world of earth where Fae rule. It used to be ruled by King Vega, but after he was murdered by Nymphs the Celestial Councillors became its rulers. The Celestial Councillors are Lionel Acrux, Melinda Altair, Tiberius Rigel, Antonia Capella. <br>
      Fae are the main occupants of Solaria. They have different elemental powers based on their zodiac signs and they can change form depending on their Order. Orders are the different forms each Fae can take. They're separated into three categories. Divisus, Taenia, Mutatio. Each order has different powers and different ways in which they recharge their powers as well as their own unique characteristics. Both physical and behavioral. The main threat to their existence are the Nymphs. <br>
      Nymphs are creatures that originated from the Shadow Realm. They are born being able to to control Shadows and in order to acquire elemental power they have to steal it from Fae by killing them. <br>
      They follow Lionel's orders and they assisted him in the murder of Hail and Merissa Vega. The majority of them treat Lavinia like a God and there are those who hate her but are under the control of her Shadows. <br>
